  TITLE     = {A Chat with ChatGPT: How will AI and GPT impact scholarly publishing? Citations, Rights, Re-Use},
  AUTHOR    = {Brady Lund},

  JOURNAL   = {UNT College of Information},
  PUBLISHER = {University of North Texas Library},
  ABSTRACT  = {The paper has two parts. The first part is an overview of GPT technology and the ChatGPT
               interface. The second part is a transcript of an interview of sorts. This interview was unique in
               that it was not conducted with a living being, but rather an AI interface. All of the questions that
               you read come from a human user, but all of the answers (labeled “A:”) were written entirely by
               the platform ChatGPT, created by the OpenAI program. It should be noted that ChatGPT is not
               perfect and there are many issues that will be identified and improved upon in the future, but this
               paper gives a taste of the platform and how it may impact our scholarly publishing
               infrastructure.This paper will begin with an introduction to ChatGPT and then proceed into the
               transcript of a conversation with the platform about it and related AI technologies’ impact on the
               future of scholarly publishing, before concluding with some discussion on the further
               implications.}

  ABSTRACT = {IBM Research undertook a challenge to build a computer system that could compete at the 
              human champion level in real time on the American TV Quiz show, Jeopardy! The extent of 
              the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely 
              a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to 
              the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of 
              intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is 
              performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the 
              Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and 
              extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, 
              evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the 
              field of QA.}
